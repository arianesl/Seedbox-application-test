Plotly was used to created the graphs and scipy was used in order to obtain the P-values.

1. In total, the company earned 185 272.4$ from 7430 transactions. 
89838.9$ (48.49%) came from the control group who did transactions online and 95433.5$ (51.51%) came from the test group who were forced to call. 

2. Overall, there were 2459 users who rebilled at least once.
Out of those users, 926 were part of the control group (web) and 1533 were part of the test group (phone call). When comparing to the total amount of transactions that were done in each group, in the control group 22.86% (926/4050) of the users rebilled at least once and for the test group,  45.36% (1533/3380) of the users rebilled at least once.

Even if there were more total transactions in the control group, there were more rebills done in the test group.  The P-value obtained was 0.41 

The data seems to indicate that a user that must call-in to cancel is more likely to generate at least 1 addition rebill but the P-value is above standard acceptance rate (>0.05) which indicates that there is still a strong posibility that the trend was due to sheer luck and we cannot reject the hypothesis that there is no difference between the two group when it comes to generating additional rebills.

3. Overall, the control group generated 89 838.90$ over 4050 transactions for an average of 22.18$ per transaction. The test group generated 95 433.50$ over 3380 transactions for an average of 28.23$ per transaction. 
A user that must call-in to cancel seems more likely to generate more revenue. 

4. In the control group, the chargeback rate is 5.72% (53/926). In the test group, the chargeback rate is 1.89% (29/1533). The users who call seem to have a lower chargeback rate. 

For both the refunds and chargebacks, the P-value is above 0.5 which indicates that there are not enough points to make a statistically valid claim.
